## Code

### cell_systems_code.nb

This is a Mathematica notebook to reproduce results and figures used in our main
manuscript. It contains functions for 

* computing key parameters of the hydrodynamic limit from ribosome profiling
  data
* simulating and predicting ribosome densities for fixed system parameters
* plotting a set of genes (with inferred hydrodynamic parameters) in a combined
  phase diagram.
